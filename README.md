Bookmark_1.5.1
==============

Source code of Barry Ezell's iPhone app Bookmark, an audiobook reader

A short history:

This repository is the source code of Bookmark, an iPhone app for
listening to audiobooks, at version 1.5.1.  The Bookmark app is
carefully designed, robustly implemented, and thus well received by
many serious audiobook readers, including myself.

As the author Barry Ezell became too busy to maintain the Bookmark
app, the app was withdrawn from the iTunes app store.  But owing to
its solid construction, the app is still miraculously functioning 
after multiple iOS upgrades.

Meanwhile Barry was looking to transfer the app so that the app can be
kept alive and supported.  At that time, I, Xiaolin (pronounced
approximately as Charlene) Zang volunteered, because I want to keep
using the app and I am also interested in app programming.

Barry generously transferred the ownership of the app to me under the
condition that the app would become open source.  Thus version 1.5.1,
the source code for the last revision before the app's withdraw is
published here.

The development of a new version is under way.  Its source code will
be made open source, too, once the app is released to the app store
again.
