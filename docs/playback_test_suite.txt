Perform these on as many devices as you can
===========================================

1. Start a multi-track book or podcast from the library view. Allow it to progress from one track to another without tapping the FF button (you can guide the time close to end of track to speed this up).  The track and titles should update correctly.

2.  Use the FF and REW buttons to test manual track changes. 

3.  Start on some multi-track track, use FF button to advance.  Exit app and resume to verify is on correct track.

4. Start a track from the book accessory detail indicator.  With a book playing, navigate back out to detail view and choose a different track.

5. Play back bookmarks from different tracks to ensure track title and time update when switching back to player.

6. Start Bookmark with a book already playing.

7. Start Bookmark with a non-book (and non-podcast) track playing. It should stop playback.

8. Try final track of a multi-track book, allow it to end and make sure no errors occur.

9. Ensure this does not happen (from matthias.otto.hb@gmail.com in version 1.5)

  While listening to an audiobook, go back to library, select any podcast and start playing. Go back to library and select the same audiobook you were just listening too. The position will show 0:00 (it forgot where we left off) and also the time remaining will still show the value of the Podcast, not the time remaining of the book.

10. Play a book, go back to library and select the same book from the tableview (not Playing).

11. Verify Complete and New reset lastTime and maxTime.

iOS4+ with backgrounding only

10.  With track playing in Bookmark, add/remove track in iTunes and sync.  MPMediaPlayerController errors will appear (when seeking current time) but these I think can be safely ignored.  When done, the PlayerViewController should pop off revealing RootViewController which will update its library.

11.  Exit Bookmark (will not be in background state).  Sync like above and reopen Bookmark.  Should refresh library when RootViewController is selected.
