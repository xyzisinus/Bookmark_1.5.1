Beta 6:

- Fixed major bug in beta 5 that made podcasts not show up at all. Oops, sorry.

Beta 7:

- Added "Expanded book search" setting for Windows users who are finding WMA and MP3 tracks won't play if they're in the Books section, but will if they're in Music. This is an Apple iOS 5 problem but I added this setting as a temporary workaround. Turning it On will include any tracks from the genres "Audiobook", "Audiobooks", or "Speech". It's turned Off by default because it negatively impacts load time.

- Fixed "shake to bookmark" bug.

Release Candidate 1 (installed as "Bookmark"):

- Fixed intermittent sort problem with bookmarks.
- Fixed "Jump to Latest Time".
